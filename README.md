Hi, I'm SebastiÃ¡n! ðŸ‘‹ My main profession is software development, but I like to think of myself as a curious person who enjoys solving problems and creating things.

#### âš¡ Side projects
- [Astrozar](https://astroz.ar) A tarot with AI. I challenged myself to make the frontend with native JavaScript, without any libraries. I learned a lot and it was fun.
- [Prichard](https://github.com/zevumara/prichard) My brother had an accident and couldn't express himself. I created this small program so he could communicate while he recovered. It's in the prototype phase.
- [The Golden Flare](https://zevumara.itch.io/the-golden-flare) A short game that a friend and I made for a game jam. It was a great experience. We plan to improve it eventually.

#### ðŸ¤” Random things about me
- I made my first website in the 2000s when I was 10-11 years old, using [FrontPage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_FrontPage) and [GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities), and it was about [Dragon Ball Z](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=loVzCHOz88Y).
- I can't stop my mind when it comes to creating things.
- I'm an enthusiastic of [pixel-art and game design](https://zevumara.itch.io).

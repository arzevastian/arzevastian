Hi, I'm SebastiÃ¡n! ðŸ‘‹ My main profession is software development, but I like to think of myself as a curious person who enjoys solving problems and creating things.

#### âš¡ Side projects
- [Astrozar](https://astroz.ar) A tarot with AI. I challenged myself to make the frontend with native JavaScript, without any libraries. I learned a lot and it was fun.
- [The Golden Flare](https://taikuhan.itch.io/the-golden-flare) A short RPG developed collaboratively with a friend for a game jam. It was an incredibly rewarding experience.
- [The Hermetic Tower](https://taikuhan.itch.io/the-hermetic-tower) A visual novel created in JavaScript for the 6th Annual Spooktober Visual Novel Jam.
